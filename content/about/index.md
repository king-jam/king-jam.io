I'm a technologist who likes dabbling in everything from material science to learning the latest and greatest of <<insert buzzword>> technology.

I've worked enough different roles that I joke that I'm a Complete-Stack Engineer (silicon all the way up to the UI/UX).

I specialize in rapid development and minimum viable product development from the ideation phase to first delivery and deployment.
